### For calculating the Pi number we have many ways which some of them are geometrics and some of them are calculating, and you can find the answer by a or some formulas


### I used from BBP algorithm, I searched about the algorithm, I found any other ways for calculating but the BBP algorithm was more logical and better than others

### This is the formula which the BBP algorithm follows it :
